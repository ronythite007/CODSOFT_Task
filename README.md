This project involves using the Iris flower dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The model is trained on sepal and petal measurements to accurately distinguish between the species. This dataset is a classic example used for introductory classification tasks.

#### Objective
To build and evaluate a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.

#### Key Activities
##### Data Preparation
Load the dataset: Import the dataset containing sepal and petal measurements for the three species.
Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, if any, and standardize the data as needed.
Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
##### Model Training
Train the model: Use machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, or support vector machines, to train the model on the training data.
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion matrix: Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's classification accuracy for each species.
##### Visualization
Feature visualization: Plot the sepal and petal measurements to visualize the data distribution.
Decision boundaries: Visualize decision boundaries for different classifiers to understand how the model differentiates between species.
Technology Used
##### Programming Language
Python
Libraries
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
seaborn: For enhanced data visualization, especially for visualizing feature distributions and pair plots.
#### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for classification tasks using the Iris flower dataset. The models developed can effectively classify the flowers into their respective species, providing a foundational understanding of classification techniques and model evaluation. This serves as a stepping stone to more complex classification problems and advanced techniques.
